Test Results (Quick Analysis)
Success:
lab_report_blood.txt → Healthcare/LabReport (Perfect)
docker_deployment_logs.log → Technology/DevOps (Spot on)
invoice_laptop_purchase.txt → Finance/Tax (Correct)
Edge Case Detected (Bug found!):
leaving_certificate_draft.txt → Technology/Other.
Why? The word "Certificate" is currently in the Technology list (meant for SSL Certificates), so it overpowered "School".
Fix for later: We should move "certificate" to a shared keyword list or negative prompt for Tech unless accompanied by "SSL/TLS".
Go ahead and try chatting with your documents! Try asking: "What is the diagnosis in the lab report?" or "Summarize the SOW timeline."
